# Apothic Attributes Rebalanced
This is a fork of [Apothic Attributes](https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/Apothic-Attributes) by [Shadows of fire](https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire).

## Changes
A change was recently made to the Apotheosis mod that nerfs the protection enchantment by reducing its effectiveness from 4% per level to 2.5% per level. This makes it so that a player needs protection 7 to reach the level of protection 4 in vanilla. This fork reverts it back to the old logic of 4% for the first 4 levels then 0.33% each level after that.

## Installation
To install this fork, simply go to [releases](https://github.com/CJACOBSON32/Apothic-Attributes-Rebalanced/releases), download the latest .jar file, and drop it into your forge mods folder.
